# finance

A basic toolset for an encrypted, multi-pronged and in-depth financial analysis.

Every toolset in this series of scripts operates under following assumptions:

- File will be opened and updated
- File will be saved and closed
- Script will be run
- Script will open file when the run is complete

---

The encryption and decrytion relies on a user provided, terminal-untracked password.
